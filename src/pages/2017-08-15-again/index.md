Mirror-lined souls now monsoon-washed, they drove over to Santo Francotico and hit up El Hotel de las Cuatro Estaciones de La Cruz del Santo Francotico, ordered a round of Aztec Yogas.
At the electric blue grand piano was famed hard moon bop jazz piano mane Cornelius None, playing an improvisational interpretation of Ludwig Rainier Maria Von Trilke’s Trillepathy for Several Seasons, the Devil’s Repose in the Angel’s Desert Campground; Sonata in Q Diagonal Majorus-Metti-Minorus.
They were getting lost in the music, Cornelius None was meticulously debarbing the cruel European mechanics of the melodies and carving a newer, truer, bluer, rawer song, the real song that was buried under all that highfalutin aristocratic pretense and toxic ego. It was as if they were hearing it for the first time, and in fact they were; it had never been played before, at least not like this.
The music took the literal physical form of a 24-story castle made of golden smoke, they entered the castle and walked up a glittering golden smoke staircase to a large ballroom glowing with the light of ten thousand chandeliers of golden smoke, from each of their mouths flew 100 doves, and the doves flew to the center of the room, coalescing into a ball of light, the light became water, the water became wine, the wine became blood, the blood became oil, the oil boiled, the engine turned, the ’84 Camino rolled on, the four seasons rolled across time in perpetuity, the ceaseless springing and falling of the earth’s vegetation, reaching for the sun, shrinking from the darkness of space, the dark highway unfurled beneath their atramentous radials, twin blacks devouring their own darkness, the stars shone bright black, the deep black light shone upon everybody, black as the night in an African jungle cave, black as the middle of the raven’s eye at midnight, the Trillepathy soared, a castle, spanish, magic, zigzag zigzag wanderin’ through the peyote karaoke, LA YOGA AZTECA, LA MAGIA, Zen, Zen, Zen, Elegua, Chango, Yemaya, Ogun, Oshun, Allah, Reality, Jah Rastafari, Fausto Bomaye, Allah Yahweh, Mashallah, Jah, Jah, Bless Up, One True Truth, The Life & Love Everlasting.
The art was hypnosis, and the diggers dug.
